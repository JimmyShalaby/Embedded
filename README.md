# Light Automation System
The Light Automation System Model is an embedded system that utilizes an LDR sensor,PIR sensor, LEDs, and wires along with a MCU to automate lighting based on ambient light conditions. 
This project aims to provide a hands-on demonstration of light automation principles using simple electronic components.
## Features
- Automatic control of LEDs based on the motion sensor(PIR)
- Real-time monitoring of light intensity using an LDR sensor.
- Easy-to-understand circuit code.
## Steps
- Clone repository to download the code.
- Connect hardware components as per the wiki-page and run code using STMCubeMX and Keil MicroVision.
